          <p>I’m a linguistics student in Paris, turning code and coffee into language tools that actually work. I
            build strict architectures, break them just fast enough, and stitch them back together.</p>

          <p>I grew up in Iran, studied English Didactics for my bachelor’s, and spent years teaching languages — Iran
            is the weight and the fire:The mountains, the poetry, the stubborn humor in the
            face of limits—it all shaped me. But every layer of beauty was wrapped in restrictions that kept tightening.
            I learned early how to bend rules, how to fight quietly, how to dream beyond the walls. Leaving felt like
            betrayal and survival at the same time; Iran is the home I argue with in my sleep.</p>

          <p>France is a paradox I live inside: I admire the art, the language, the streets that look like museums—yet
            every paper, queue, and prefecture visit feels like punishment for existing. I came here to study and build,
            not to wrestle with endless forms and stamps. Still, the chaos sharpens me. Paris is the place where I code,
            curse, and somehow grow.</p>

          <p>Today I’m buried in computational linguistics and code. Most hours go into a 15k-line web app where I
            juggle JavaScript, TypeScript, React/Next.js, and Python backends. I wire LLMs, TTS, and my own NLP
            pipelines together under a Clean Architecture skeleton, then break it apart when the edges don’t fit. It’s
            messy, ambitious, and closer to a second brain than anything else I’ve built. When I’m not wrestling with
            syntax, I’m debugging late at night, chasing down why some CSS refuses to listen, or writing small Python
            scripts that scrape, classify, or just prove to me I still control the machine.</p>

          <p>When I’m not coding, I’m usually out with my cheap camera, saying the wrong French words to the wrong
            people, or reading random stuff that starts deep and ends dumb. None of it makes sense, but it feels like
            me.</p>
