          <p>I’m a linguistics/NLP student in Paris trying to turn code and coffee into language tools that actually
            work. I build clean web interfaces, keep my architectures strict, and break things just fast enough to fix
            them again.</p>

          <p>I grew up in Iran, studied English Didactics for my bachelor’s, and spent years teaching languages — which
            means I’ve heard every possible grammar mistake twice and still somehow enjoy it. That teaching background
            now leaks into my code: I obsess over making interfaces as clear as a good classroom explanation.</p>

          <p>France is a paradox I live inside: I admire the art, the language, the streets that look like cinema—yet
            every paper, queue, and prefecture visit feels like punishment for existing. I came here to study and build,
            not to wrestle with endless forms and stamps. Still, the chaos sharpens me. Paris is the place where I code,
            curse, and somehow grow.</p>

          <p>Iran is the weight I carry and the fire that made me. The mountains, the poetry, the stubborn humor in the
            face of limits—it all shaped me. But every layer of beauty was wrapped in restrictions that kept tightening.
            I learned early how to bend rules, how to fight quietly, how to dream beyond the walls. Leaving felt like
            betrayal and survival at the same time; Iran is the home I argue with in my sleep.</p>


          <p>These days I’m deep into computational linguistics and my main project: a 15k-line web app that throws
            LLMs, TTS, and custom NLP pipelines into one Clean Architecture blender. It’s messy, ambitious, and the
            closest thing I’ve built to a second brain.</p>

          <p>When I’m not coding, I’m out with a camera, butchering French idioms, or writing half-serious thoughts
            about tech and learning. It keeps me sane and reminds me that technology should feel more like a creative
            outlet than a corporate treadmill.</p>
