                    I do think I have lost a part of my brain that was correcting
                    while I was making a grammatical mistakes, due to overuse of autocorrection
                    in my phone,
                    <br>and that's baaaad.<br>
                    well, let alone the thinking part of my brain and decesion making ability that I
                    lost to LLMs.

                    I think the easy answer is never the correct answer to any problem,
                    and oh boy, learning been always difficult and it never comes easy...

                <h2>why its a debt</h2>
                </p>


                To answer this questions I have to mention my experience; <br></br>
                In the process of teaching, I see students get happy when they're correct
                on answering a question, and they get angry otherwise.
                that's natural, meanwhile, in my eyes,this is the most shallow perception of
                the process.
                learning is mostly about about improving at approching to questions, in a way that
                we develope the <strong>problem-solving skill</strong> for life.
                <br></br>
                and how I traded my <em>learning</em> with getting the right answer in
                the shortest amount of time by prompting it to a LLM?
                I dunno, honestly I thought I am making a good decesion, tho tunred out
                to be that I am wrong.
                I traded the most valuable and important of the process with
                just being "Fast",<br></br>
                <em>since when the issue was speed </em>
                <br></br>
                I will pay the price of speed, every line of code,<br> every line of
                text, message, email... it was a liablity that I negotiated it...
